#The bash script I designed serves the purpose of analyzing candidate password files iteratively. The script employs a structured approach, utilizing read for user input and nested loops for file validation, ensuring the file's existence and non-emptiness. It calculates the maximum line length by iterating through the lines, employing 'grep with regular expressions for extracting allowed and disallowed characters. The 'printf' statement is used for formatted and color-coded output, enhancing readability. User interaction is incorporated, prompting whether to process another file, adding a layer of usability. The script effectively combines core Bash commands, loop structures, and formatting techniques, showcasing a comprehensive use of fundamental concepts in shell scripting.
#this is to start an infinite loop until expression broken.
while true; do 
    #prompt user for a file name, and the input is stored in the variable 
    #(read -p) is used to remove the extra need for the echo statement.
    read -p "Enter the name of the candidate password file (including ext): " filename

    #used a nested loop to check if the specified fileÂ exists and is not empty.
    while [ ! -s "$filename" ]; do
        #If not, it shows user that file does not exist or is empty
        echo "The file does not exist or is empty"
        #It prompts the user again to enter a valid file name.
        read -p "Enter the name of the candidate password file (including ext): " filename
    done

#It reads each line from the file specified by the user and calculates the maximum line length.

#is to create an aloop that reads each line from the file specified by $filename.
# The IFS= ensures leading and trailing whitespaces are preserved
# -r prevents backslashes from being treated as escape characters.

    if [ "$current_length" -gt "$max_length" ]; then
        #If the current line is longer than the previously recorded maximum, it updates max_length with the length of the current line
        max_length="$current_length"
        #by the end of this loop, max_length will hold the length of the longest line in the file. This information is then used for formatting the output later in the script.

#now it gives tht output same as the screenshot provided in assignment
#When the user enters a file name that does not exist or is empty, the program prompts them to re-enter. but when the user enters a file that exists, the program runs based on that file name. What if the user needs to run another file? program does not support that part. In my opinion, it was a little issue.
#So using the knowledge I have gained so far, I add a part that asks the user whether he needs to do more operations or not. If yes, the program continues to run as before.
